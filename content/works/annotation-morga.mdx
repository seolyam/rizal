## Why Rizal Annotated Morga

While in London in 1889, Rizal immersed himself in the British Museum to study Antonio de Morga’s seventeenth-century chronicle. By annotating the text, he repositioned Filipino history from the colonizer’s margins to the center, countering stereotypes of backwardness and emphasizing precolonial sophistication.[8][10]

## Key Interventions

- **Economic Flourishing.** Rizal highlights maritime trade with China, Japan, and Southeast Asia, proving that commerce thrived long before Spanish rule.[10]
- **Cultural Literacy.** He documents indigenous writing systems, diplomacy, and craftsmanship, undermining the myth of cultural emptiness.[8][10]
- **Critique of Conquest.** Marginal notes expose the violence of colonization and the decline in population, agriculture, and autonomy under Spain.[9][10]
- **Religious Plurality.** Rizal challenges the notion that Catholicism solely “civilized” the islands, pointing to blended belief systems within colonial expeditions.[10]

## Annotated Structure

1. **Chapter Summaries with Corrections.** Rizal comments on each section, clarifying geography, ethnography, and technology.
2. **Historical Glosses.** Footnotes insert indigenous terminology and clarify political alliances erased by official chronicles.[11]
3. **Comparative Analysis.** References to Chinese and Malay sources situate the Philippines within a wider regional network.[10]

## Historical Impact

Rizal’s edition became the first major history of the archipelago written from a Filipino perspective. It inspired later nationalist historiography and offered ilustrados a documented basis for pride in precolonial achievements. The work also influenced American-era historians who debated the legacies of Spanish colonialism.[8][9]
