## Significance

While in London, Rizal immersed himself in the British Museum to study Morga's eyewitness account of 16th-century Philippines. His annotations correct colonial biases, emphasizing Filipino maritime trade, metallurgy, and social systems prior to Spanish rule.

## Key Interventions

- **Economic Flourishing** — Rizal highlights trade routes that linked the archipelago with China, Japan, and Southeast Asia.
- **Cultural Sophistication** — He documents indigenous literacy and craftsmanship, countering narratives of backwardness.
- **Critique of Conquest** — Notes draw attention to violence committed by conquistadors, reframing Spain's "civilizing mission."
