## Summary

Serving as the gateway to his annotated edition of Antonio de Morga’s 1609 chronicle, Rizal’s prologue announces that the archipelago possessed vibrant commerce, social order, and culture long before Spanish conquest. He invites Filipinos to study authentic records, reject colonial slander, and rebuild national identity on historical truth rather than imposed narratives.[14][9]

## Themes

- **Precolonial Prosperity.** Rizal recounts trading networks, craftsmanship, and governance to demonstrate that the islands flourished independently of Spain.[9]
- **Narrative Correction.** The prologue reframes Philippine history from a Filipino perspective, challenging readers to scrutinize colonial bias and its lingering effects.[14]
- **Call to Memory.** By urging compatriots to reclaim their archives, Rizal positions history as a tool for political renewal.

## Historical Impact

The prologue set the stage for Rizal’s annotations, preparing readers to interpret Morga’s chronicle critically. It helped ilustrados articulate pride in precolonial achievements and inspired future historians to craft narratives centered on Filipino agency.[9][14]
