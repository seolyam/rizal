## Summary

Published in Ghent as a sequel to *Noli Me Tángere*, *El Filibusterismo* returns Crisóstomo Ibarra—now the jeweler Simoun—to colonial Manila. He cultivates elite patrons while secretly plotting an explosion that will wipe out friars and officials. The plan collapses, forcing him and his allies to confront the moral cost of vengeance, the failures of reform, and the tragedy of unrealized revolution.[15][16][19]

## Major Themes

- **Revolution vs. Reform.** Simoun’s shift from peaceful activism to violent conspiracy traces the evolution of Filipino resistance under intensifying repression.[15][19]
- **Corruption and Injustice.** The novel catalogs the abuses of friars, bureaucrats, and collaborators, revealing how systemic hypocrisy provokes despair.[17]
- **Sacrifice and Martyrdom.** Characters such as Basilio, Juli, and Padre Florentino embody the personal toll of rebellion, emphasizing that liberation demands profound loss.[15][19]
- **Societal Awakening.** Student organizers and ilustrados discover the necessity of collective action, even as they disagree on method and pace.[16]

## Characters to Track

- **Simoun (Ibarra).** Disguised avenger whose failed plot dramatizes the perils of retaliatory violence.
- **Basilio and Isagani.** Young reformists who wrestle with Simoun’s tactics and the boundaries of moral action.
- **Padre Florentino.** A conscience figure who questions whether freedom gained through terror can endure.
- **Friars and Officials.** Embody entrenched corruption and social decay that Simoun seeks to eradicate.[15][19]

## Historical Impact

Smuggled into the Philippines and banned like its predecessor, the novel fueled discourse within the Propaganda Movement about reform versus revolution. Its darker tone challenged ilustrados to evaluate whether violent upheaval could succeed where petitions failed, and it equipped later revolutionaries with language for sacrifice, conscience, and state violence.[16][18][19]
