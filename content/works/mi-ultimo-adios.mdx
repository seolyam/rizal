## Historical Moment

Composed on the eve of his execution on 30 December 1896, *Mi Último Adiós* was hidden inside an alcohol stove and entrusted to his family. The poem's 14 stanzas weave together love of country, sacrificial imagery, and a vision of dawn for the oppressed.

## Key Lines for Analysis

- **Stanza 3** — Rizal offers his blood to "tint" the dawn, portraying martyrdom as illumination.
- **Stanza 9** — References to the "children who will see the morning" underscore intergenerational responsibility.
- **Final Stanza** — The farewell becomes a call to remember fallen heroes without bitterness.
