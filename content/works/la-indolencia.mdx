## Essay Context

Rizal wrote *La Indolencia* while based in Madrid, responding to accusations by Spanish writers that Filipinos were inherently lazy. Across five installments in *La Solidaridad*, he repositions the argument toward structural critique.

## Argument Highlights

1. **Forced Labor Policies** — The polo y servicios and encomienda systems extracted labor without compensation, discouraging productivity.
2. **Trade Restrictions** — The Manila galleon monopoly throttled local enterprise and fostered dependence on Spain-run markets.
3. **Climate Acknowledgment** — Rizal acknowledges tropical climates but emphasizes that pre-colonial societies were industrious before Spanish conquest.
