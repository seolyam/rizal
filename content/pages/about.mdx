## Mission

We designed this project to make Rizal's life and works accessible through immersive storytelling, responsibly curated sources, and thoughtful visuals. The site blends scholarship with creative interaction to support coursework mandated by the Rizal Law.

## Goals

- Offer a structured yet exploratory learning path from biography to legacy.
- Present primary sources alongside annotations for classroom use.
- Provide educators with ready-to-use timelines, map references, and activity prompts.

## Design Principles

1. **Accuracy first** — Every timeline entry, quotation, and artifact references a verifiable source.
2. **Accessibility** — WCAG-conformant color contrast, keyboard-first navigation, and a reduce-motion option shape the experience.
3. **Performance** — Optimized Next.js routes, image compression, and client-side caching keep the site responsive on low bandwidth.

## Credits

- **Research & Content** — University history fellows and collaborating educators.
- **Design** — UI inspired by archival paper textures and serif typography reminiscent of 19th-century printing.
- **Development** — Built with Next.js 16, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components, Framer Motion, MDX, and Zustand.
